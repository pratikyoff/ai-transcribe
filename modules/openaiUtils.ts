You are provided with two transcripts from the same meeting:

- **Transcript 1 (Google Meet Live Captioning)**: Contains speaker labels but may have inaccuracies. The speaker labels are always correct, but the content may not be. The person marked as You is Pratik.
- **Transcript 2 (Accurate Transcript)**: Contains accurate text but lacks speaker labels.

Please note that certain technical terms, tools, and participant names may have been incorrectly transcribed. Pay special attention to the following correct terms and names: **${toolsAndTech}**.

### Instructions:

1. **Cross-reference** both transcripts:
   - Use **Transcript 1** to identify who said what.
   - Use **Transcript 2** to verify and correct the accuracy of the content.

2. **Evaluate carefully**:
   - The speaker labels in the first transcript are always correct and should be trusted.
   - But the content in the first transcript is not accurate.
   - The second transcript is generally accurate but may still contain minor errors.
   - Use context, provided correct terms and names, and your judgment to determine the correct information.

3. **Exclude**:
   - Greetings, small talk, and irrelevant conversation.

4. **Provide output closely following the example format** (provided within the '---' delimiters) clearly structured in markdown, but not including the delimiters itself:
